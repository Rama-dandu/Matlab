%% Power Spectral Density - describes how the power (or energy) of a signal is distributed across different frequency components. 
% It is a key tool for analyzing signals in the frequency domain
% Units - watts/Hz

time = 0:1/fs:1;

% sine wave
fm = 50;
sine = sin(2 * pi * fm * time) + 0.5 * randn(size(time));

%% Observations
% The PSD plot shows how the power of the signal is distributed across different frequencies.
% Main Peak at 50 Hz:The sinusoidal component of the signal sin(2Ï€50t) contributes most of the power, so the PSD has a prominent peak at 50Hz
% Broadband Noise: The added random noise spreads power across a wide range of frequencies, causing the PSD to rise at non-sinusoidal frequencies.
